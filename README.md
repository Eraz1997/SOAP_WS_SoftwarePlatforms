## SOAP_WS_SoftwarePlatforms

Basic example of Service-oriented Architecture, thought docker-compose, Tomcat, Axis2.

We built 2 service containers:
- WebService -> Tomcat + Axis2 container with CipherService and TCPDumpService 
- Client -> Python container with client.py

Start the example though:

    sudo docker-compose up
